Another basic repository for learning git-hub.

Hi everyone!

This is just a text file to learn the git-hub tutorials.
Thank you for all the open-source experts, developers, and
techies to make all these unified, cooperative ventures
possible.

A new world of infinite possibilities lie open before us 
for creating a better, peaceful, harmonious society, human
civilization, and cosmos. Light has begun to dawn on us. 
The prospect for an ever brighter future governed by good

Let's press on being guided by the inner promptings of
life shaped and fashioned by a heart, which through experience,
has been captured by truth, devotion, and love!

Two years have passed since I started and wrote the above notes.
I have done nothing since then but continue my study of coding.

I'm now back to continue and finish what I have started.

Let's do whatever it takes, under love and good, to build a
better world.
